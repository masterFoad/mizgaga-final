1.1. Download this folder (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q0ASJnjeCENuOgfz7ygUuSEUIaH07EZ_?usp=sharing) into C:/final-project-application
-- configuration step - only needed whenever we have to set up a new wifi connection

1.4. set wifi.password=<your wifi password>

-- the project is now running on localhost:8995
5. open chrome
6. go to localhost:8995/index.html
-- the app now is waiting for a connection to the sensor via wifi
-- we need to prepare for that
7. click "CONNECT"
